# Why

Investigate the motivation and intent behind code.

Companion to the `how` skill. `how` answers what the code does and how it works. `why` answers what forces led to its shape.

Each spawn below names a role in Pi's `pstack_models` configuration. Use its effective `provider/model:thinking` selector from the injected role table or `pstack_models` action `get`, including resolved `auto` and `inherit-parent` choices. If the role is unresolved or its selector is rejected, report the gap and obtain a valid choice through setup or the user. Do not substitute a model or omit the role.

## Operating Posture

Operate as a **careful, cautious, and precise investigator**. Be honest about what you know vs what you're inferring. Read `references/epistemics.md` for the full confidence framework and phrasing guide. The synthesizer must follow it.

## Step 1. Understand the Target and the Question

Parse what the user is asking. The **target** is usually a chunk of code, a pattern, a feature, or a named design decision. The **question** is usually a design rationale, a tradeoff, a motivating edge case, an external constraint, dead code, or a broad history sweep.

If the target is vague ("why do we do it this way?" with no clear referent), make your best guess from conversation context (supplied paths or excerpts, recent edits, what was just discussed). State your interpretation briefly so the user can redirect if you're off, then proceed.

## Step 2. Establish the Code Anchor

Before spawning investigators, anchor the investigation in concrete code. You need:

- The relevant file path(s) and line range(s)
- The key symbols (function names, class names, constants)
- An initial commit list. The last few commits touching the target.
- PR numbers from merge commits (pattern `(#1234)` in the subject line)

Build this inline.

```bash
# Blame target lines for last-touch commits
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>

# Full file history, with patches, through renames
git log --follow -p -- <file>

# Last N commits touching the file, PR numbers visible
git log --oneline -20 -- <file>

# Extract PR numbers from a commit message
git log -1 --format=%B <commit>
```

Pull PR bodies and discussion via `gh` for any substantive commits:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,createdAt,mergedAt,labels,closingIssuesReferences,comments,reviews
```

Capture this as seed context (file paths, symbols, commits, PR numbers, linked ticket IDs). Pass it to the investigators.

## Step 3. Spawn Parallel Investigators (default posture)

**Default to the full parallel investigation.**

### Discovery

Before spawning investigators, identify the evidence sources available through this Pi session's tools and documented integrations. These may be native Pi extension tools, configured MCP integrations, or documented CLIs. Inspect the exposed tool descriptions, schemas, and integration guidance. Use an integration's discovery facility when it supplies one; do not assume a Cursor `mcps/` directory or invent discovery calls. MCP is a protocol, not a synonym for every external-data tool.

Map each available evidence-source integration to one category:

1. Source control history
2. Issue / ticket tracker
3. Long-form documents
4. Real-time team chat
5. Infrastructure observability
6. Error / exception tracking
7. Product analytics warehouse

Source control uses git and `gh`; report missing commands, repository access, or authentication rather than claiming a search was performed. For the other six, classify using the integration's descriptions, tool schemas, documentation, and any exposed MCP server instructions or resource descriptors. If an integration could fit more than one category, choose the one matching its primary evidence. Record ambiguous cases in the coverage map. Tool availability in the parent does not prove access in a child; report a child startup or access failure as a gap, not a completed query.

Aim for a complete **coverage map**, not a minimal one. Document the null, don't skip the search.

Launch all matching investigators with `pstack_task` in a single message so they run concurrently. Don't ask one agent to cover multiple evidence-source integrations.

Subagent config (each):
- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: the effective `why investigators` selector
- `readonly`: `false`. Pi's PStack read-only children expose only the restricted built-in and helper tools, not the integration tools or shell needed here. This enables the required tools; it does not authorize writes. Investigators must not edit files or modify external state.

Before launching each investigator, read and assemble its prompt from these inputs:
1. The base prompt from `references/investigator-prompt.md`
2. The category playbook `references/sources/<source>.md` for the selected integration, adapted from the MCP and CLI examples in `references/source-playbook.md`
3. The cross-cutting `references/sources/incident-postmortem.md` **if the target code looks defensive** (null checks, retry logic, timeout handling, rate limiting, feature flags, egress guards, OOM handlers)
4. The code anchor from Step 2 (file paths, symbols, commit hashes, PR numbers, ticket IDs)
5. The user's original question

### Investigator roster. One per available evidence category

Spawn one investigator per category that has a matching evidence source. Each owns one source integration, whether exposed through native Pi tools, MCP, or a documented CLI.

Each entry names the category and the kind of "why" it uniquely surfaces. Use it to know what to expect back, how to name a gap when a category returns empty, and (only in the rare provably-irrelevant case) to justify a skip.

1. **Source control investigator**. Git history, `gh` for PRs, code comments, tests. Always spawn. Report any repository, command, or access gaps. Best at surfacing *implementation-time rationale captured during review*.

2. **Issue / ticket tracker investigator** (e.g. Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Plane, Shortcut MCP). Best at surfacing *the product or business forcing function*. Strongest when the why is external to engineering.

3. **Long-form documents investigator** (e.g. Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Coda MCP). Best at surfacing *long-form design rationale*. Where the why is written out before it becomes code.

4. **Real-time team chat investigator** (e.g. Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost MCP). Best at surfacing *real-time deliberation that never reached a doc*. Especially important when the source control, ticket, and doc paper trail is thin.

5. **Infrastructure observability investigator** (e.g. Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana, Splunk MCP). Infra/runtime view. Best at surfacing *infrastructure and runtime reality that motivated the code*. Strongest when the target reacts to an infra signal (timeouts, retries, rate limits, circuit breakers).

6. **Error / exception tracking investigator** (e.g. Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag, Airbrake MCP). Best at surfacing *the specific exceptions and error trajectories that motivated defensive or corrective code*. Strongest for catch blocks, null guards, type checks, retries, and other defenses.

7. **Product analytics warehouse investigator** (e.g. Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, dbt, Redshift MCP). Product/data view. Best at surfacing *product and data reality that shaped the code*. Strongest for flag-gated code, experiment-driven ships, data migrations, and "where did this number come from" questions.

### When to skip an investigator

Only skip with an **explicit, written justification** that goes in the final "Sources Consulted" section. Two valid reasons:

- **No usable evidence integration is available for that category** in this environment. Flag this as a gap, not a choice, and distinguish absence from an access failure. Example: "Real-time team chat skipped. No matching tool, MCP integration, or documented CLI was available, so the conversational record was not searchable."
- **The source is provably irrelevant**, not just "probably irrelevant." A high bar. Example: "Error / exception tracking skipped. Target is a build-time script with no runtime code path."

If your scope assessment suggests a single-commit trivial target where the PR description already contains the complete answer, you may answer inline **only after** confirming all seven available category searches would be redundant. Say so explicitly. This should be rare.

## Step 4. Synthesize

Spawn one synthesizer subagent:

- `subagent_type`: `generalPurpose`
- `model`: the effective `why synthesizer` selector
- `readonly`: `false`. Citation spot-checks may need integration tools or shell commands that Pi's PStack read-only children do not expose. The synthesizer must not edit files or modify external state.

Before launching the synthesizer, read the framework and prompt template below and fill the template's EPISTEMICS_PATH with the framework's absolute path. Assemble these inputs:
1. The investigator findings, including any null results and any categories skipped with justification
2. The code anchor from Step 2 (file paths, symbols, commit hashes, PR numbers, ticket IDs)
3. The user's original question
4. The epistemics framework from `references/epistemics.md`
5. The synthesizer prompt template from `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`

## Step 5. Present

Take the synthesizer's output and present it to the user. You may lightly edit for clarity or add context from the conversation, but **do not rewrite the confidence language**.

## Output Format

The output structure is the one in `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`: The Question, The Code in Question, What We Found, What We Can Reasonably Infer, Competing Hypotheses, What We Don't Know, Sources Consulted, Confidence Summary. Adapt as needed, but keep the confidence separation intact, and keep Sources Consulted as one line per investigator, including the ones that returned nothing or were skipped, with the reason.

After the Sources Consulted block, if the user's `why` question is a precursor to actually changing this code, convert the lineage findings into a Preserve / Change / Avoid / Risk constraint set suitable for planning the change.

## Common Failure Modes to Avoid

- **Recency bias**. Assuming the most recent commit is authoritative. The current shape is often the accretion of many earlier decisions. Trace back.

## Reference Files

- `references/epistemics.md`. Confidence tiers and phrasing guide. The synthesizer must follow it.
- `references/investigator-prompt.md`. Base prompt template for investigator subagents.
- `references/source-playbook.md`. Index pointing at the category playbooks below.
- `references/sources/*.md`. One self-contained example playbook per category, plus cross-cutting `incident-postmortem.md`. Give an investigator the single file that matches its category and adapt it to the available integration's actual tools and schemas.
- `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`. Prompt template for the synthesizer subagent, including the output format.
