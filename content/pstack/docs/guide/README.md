# The pstack guide

These pages retain upstream examples with excluded workflows removed. Their command spellings and host setup are source reference. Use the Pi package's [README](../../../../README.md) for registered commands, installation, and support boundaries.

pstack works best when you stop micromanaging the agent. You describe what you want and how you'll know it's done. `/poteto-mode` picks the playbook, runs the other skills as the steps need them, and shows you the evidence. This guide teaches that habit with realistic prompts.

Here's what you'll learn:

1. [Set up pstack](./01-setup.md). Install the plugin and pick your models.
2. [Route work through `/poteto-mode`](./02-poteto-mode.md). Give it a goal and watch it pick a playbook.
3. [Understand the code](./03-understand.md). `/how`, `/why`, `/teach`, and `/recall` before you edit anything.
4. [Design the change](./04-design.md). `/architect`, `/arena`, `/swarm`, and `/interrogate` before code locks in a shape.
5. [Build and clean the change](./05-build-and-clean.md). The build playbooks, `/tdd`, `/unslop`, and `/no-comments`.
6. [Verify and open a PR](./06-verify-and-ship.md). Prove behavior on the real app, then open a focused PR and address review and CI.
7. [Audit a local run](./07-overnight.md). A checkable finish condition and a decision log you can audit.
8. [Steer with principle names](./08-principles.md). The 23 names that redirect an agent mid-task.
9. [Make it yours](./09-make-it-yours.md). Your own mode, plus how to test a skill change.
10. [Recipes and pitfalls](./10-recipes-and-pitfalls.md). Prompts to copy and mistakes to skip.

Read the pages in order the first time. After that, each page stands alone.

## If you only remember one thing

Give the agent a goal and a way to check it, in your own words:

```text
/poteto-mode the export writes duplicate rows when a retry lands mid-run. repro first, then fix and verify.
```

You don't need to name a playbook or list skills. "repro first" and a checkable outcome are all the routing signal `/poteto-mode` needs. It matches the Bug fix playbook, copies the steps into a todo list, and calls the right skills as each step fires.

Next: [Set up pstack](./01-setup.md).
